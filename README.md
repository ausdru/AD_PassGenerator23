## Description
The motivation behind this project was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I've written. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
